# Scott Anderson Portfolio Website
 
### In this respository I created my portfolio website! I am very proud of my portfolio website and would love if you could check it out @ scottanderson.me . I would like to thank Mike Colbert, my professor at the University of Iowa for his help with this project!

### For my portfolio project, I created my own template using HTML in Visual Studio Code. I also used CSS for formatting. I wanted to do a cookie popup when someone gets onto my index.html page, and to do this I used just a little bit of javascript that my professor Mike Colbert helped me with at the University of Iowa. 

I have uploaded a little bit about me with a professional photograph of myself, my data wrangling project, resume, and how to contact me on my website. Please check it out, as it showcases some of the skills I learned during my digital product management class here at the University of Iowa.
